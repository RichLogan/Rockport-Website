                    for information exchange, known as the ACRIS initiative. ACRIS stands for Airport Community Recommended Information Services.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">IATA/ACI Baggage XML initiative. </h4>
                    <p>Rockport actively participates in the IATA/ACI Baggage XML initiative. 
                    This initiative has developed a new standard for bag messaging that will revolutionise the world of Baggage Operations. 
                    The new standard, known as Recommended Practice 1755, built using the IATA AIDM (Airline Industry Data Model), will replace RP 1745 in due course. 
                    This will greatly facilitate the reduction in misconnected bags. 
                    It will also support the new IATA Resolution 753 that requires airlines to provide certain mandatory information to passengers regarding the location of their bags.
                    </p>
